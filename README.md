It's very scrappy, but this was a fun little project I made in the summer before college to help me create a course schedule. I was overwhelmed by all the possible classes I could take, and I was worried that in manually arranging my class schedule, there was some *perfect* schedule out there that was feasible, but that I just hadn't discovered yet. One of the jupyter notebooks above scrapes course information from the Princeton website, and the other takes constraints like classes per day, classes per department, etc. and produces graphics of every possible schedule fitting my constraints. The algorithm I used was actually a weird application of the kSum problem on LeetCode, which was pretty cool to see find a real-world application. The results are in the folders, labeled by the datetime they were generated.
